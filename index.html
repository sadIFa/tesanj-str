<h2>About </h2>
<p id="uvod">Tešanj is a town set among the hills by a little river called Tešanjka. It is located in the north of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is a part of Zenica-Doboj canton. The area of the town is around 160 kilometers square and it has the population of around 50 000, which makes the population density around 320 people per square kilometer. Besides the beautiful nature, Tešanj also has a rich cultural history. In the core of Tešanj is the old town with the city's fortress, which is one of the biggest by area in Bosnia and Hezegovina. Archeologic research shows that the fortress dates from prehistorc periods. Next to the fortress is the clock tower, built in 17th century, which is one of the only four in Bosnia that has never stopped working. Near the old part of the town is also the Ferhat bey's mosque, which was built in 1564. Ferhat bey, who had it built, was burried next to the mosque and the epitaph on it is the oldest islamic writing in this area. Another significant structure worth visiting is Eminagića konak, which was built in 1800s and is now turned into a museum. Among other things Tešanj is known for, the mineral waters being produced in Tešanj are definately one of the most important ones. There are several mineral springs and most of them have won the biggest worldwide ompetitions for quality.  Tešanj is said to be the appendix of Bosnia, since you can't stop in Tešanj on your way to somewhere else because of the roads leading to it, so your end goal should be Tešanj. However, even with this being the case, the economy in Tešanj is blossoming so much that it was in  top seven cities in Bosnia by economy growth, alongside Sarajevo's municipalities, Tuzla, Mostar and other significally bigger cities.  </p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p id="historija"> Beside the city's fortress being archeologically found to be from the prehistorc period, there are other proves that Tešanj dates from earlier ages. In the 900s, Konstantin Porfirogenet mentions a country by the name of Bosnia and in it, two towns called Desnik and Kotorac. Kotorac is today's Kotor-Varoš and Desnik was said to be Tešanj. The town is mentioned as Tešanj first time in 1400s in a charter written by Bosnia's king at that time. In 1465, the Turks establish the Bosnian kingdom, whose capital was Tešanj. Later on, it was the center of its nahija and later kadiluk. Significant for the development of Tešanj in this period was Ferhat bey, the cousin of Suleiman the Magnificent. During his time, mosques, mektebs, a medresa,han and many other structures were built. During the Austro-Hungarian period, development of Tešanj further continues, but is stopped as SHS takes over. In the last decades, Tešanj continues to be the center of development in Zenica-Doboj canton. </p>
